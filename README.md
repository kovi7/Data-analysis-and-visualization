## üåç Project 1: Global Population Analysis


Using [World Bank population data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2023&start=1960) & [UW schedule 25/26](https://monitor.uw.edu.pl/Lists/Uchway/Attachments/7221/M.2025.15.Post.1.pdf):

- **Animated bar/line/bubble plots** (color & B&W) for:
  - Top 5 most populated countries
  - Chile/Poland with 4 closest neighbors (by population)
- **Contextual animations**: highlight events (genocity in Myanmar)
- **Gantt charts**: event timelines from PDF academic document, in color and grayscale
- All visuals use `matplotlib.animation` and are saved as `.gif` and `.pdf`

## üå°Ô∏è Project 2: Global Temperature Trends

Based on temperature records (1750‚Äì2023) for multiple cities and countries. Source [global temperature data](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~lukaskoz/teaching/dav/labs/lab4/temperature.csv) available in data folder.

- **Data cleaning**: conversion to Celsius, NA removal, column simplification
- **Scatter, box, and violin plots**
- **Grouped time series plots**: multi-subplots, color-coded per country and city

Deliverables:
- 15+ `.py` scripts for each plot (`task2a.py`, ..., `task5e.py`)
- Final PDF report with plots only 
- All plots exported as `.png`

## üìâ Project 3: The Importance of Plotting

Inspired by the famous Anscombe's Quartet and its modern extensions, this project demonstrates how datasets with **identical summary statistics** can look dramatically different.

- Dataset `ans.csv`: classic Anscombe's Quartet in one composite plot
- Dataset `ans2.tsv`: multi-subplot visualization for hidden distributions
- Calculations include: mean, variance, correlation, regression line, R¬≤
- Jupyter Notebook with analysis, plots, and tables
- Rendered HTML report with all visuals

## üß≠ Project 4: Interactive Plots

Exploration of interactive Python visualization libraries with a focus on **cross-library consistency**.

### Libraries used:
- `mpld3`
- `pygal`
- `bokeh`

### Task:
For **each library**, two **different types of plots** were implemented:

- **Scatter plot**
- **Boxplot**

This results in a total of **6 interactive plots** (3 scatter plots + 3 boxplots).  
Each library recreates the **same two plots** using its own syntax and tools, while maintaining **similar structure, layout, labels, colors, and styling** ‚Äî to allow for visual comparison across technologies.

üéØ The goal was to evaluate capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each library in rendering the same visual concept.

Each script supports a positional parameter `[0/1]`:
```bash
python mpld3_scatter.py 0   # show interactive plot
python mpld3_scatter.py 1   # save the plot (HTML)
```

## üîÆ Project 5: Time Series Forecasting
Forecasting country-level temperatures for the next 250 years, based on cleaned data from Project 2.

- **Data aggregation**: calculate average annual temperature for 8 countries
- **initial visualizations**: 8 scatter plots (one per country) to identify trends and seasonality
- **Forecasting**: for Japan/France/Brazil/New Zealand/Poland/Sweden/Ukraine 3 forecasting models were used including 95% confidence intervals in all predictions

### Forecasting methods used:
- `Autoregression model(AR)`
- `Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)`
- `Holt-Winters expotential smoothing(HWES)`


### Cross-validation results (MAE):
| Country   |     AR |   ARIMA |   HWES |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Brazil    | 0.3673 |  0.3932 | 0.3621 |
| France    | 0.5431 |  0.5875 | 0.5801 |

## üß¨ Project 6: Isoelectric Point Classifier
Model to classify proteins/peptides as **acidic** (pI < 5.0) or **non-acidic** using features extracted from sequences.

Source:
- [IPC Protein](http://isoelectric.org/datasets/pip_ch2d19_2_1st_isoform_outliers_3units_cleaned_0.99.fasta)
- [IPC Peptide](http://isoelectric.org/datasets/Gauci_PHENYX_SEQUEST_0.99_duplicates_out.fasta)

### Preprocess:
- Clean and analyze raw `.fasta` sequences
- Visualize pI and sequence length (histograms, IQRs)
- Extract:
  - 550 acidic proteins (pI < 5.0)
  - 550 basic proteins (pI > 10.0)
  - 550 acidic peptides
  - 550 the most basic peptides
- Merge and label into unified FASTA:
``` bash
uid|protein/peptide|pI|label
SEQUENCE
```

### Deep Learning Model

Using `PyTorch`:

- Several Dense Neural Networks were trained, experimenting with:
  - Different numbers of hidden layers and units
  - Activation functions (ReLU, GeLu)
- Most models achieved high classification performance, indicating that the selected features are well-suited for the task
- Best-performing models were saved in both .json (architecture) and .h5 (weights) formats.

#### Inference Script:

```bash
python acidic_protein_dl_predictor.py -i input.fasta -o output_pred.fasta
```

Example output format:
```bash
